# Animal Shelter 🐶🐱🐴🪿

### Our project provides functionalities to facilitate the management of an animal shelter, which includes the animals, their caretakers, adoptions, and shelter operations. Specifically, our database keeps track of the different animals, and their food, and tracks the interactions between staff/volunteers and the animals, whilst allowing administrative staff to manage appointments made by clients to visit the animal shelter.
